# R_example_code
Various examples of R code, R markdown code etc

## Exercise with R markdown:
* Create a folder called _code_ and a directory called _objs_ at the same level (so both in the same folder, not one within the other) somewhere on your computer (for example, in a folder specific to R projects or to this meetup).
* Save example\_markdown.Rmd in the _code_ folder and open in RStudio.
* You may get prompted to install various packages - agree to do this.
    * Can first install the rmarkdown package using install.packages("rmarkdown") unless you have used it before.
    * Also install the packages kable and kableExtra (and any other packages that you may get prompted to install!)
* Press the "knit" button and see what happens! What files get generated and where are they?
