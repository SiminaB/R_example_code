# R_example_code
Various examples of R code, R markdown code etc

## Exercise with R markdown:
* First need to install the rmarkdown package using install.packages(``rmarkdown") unless you have used it before.
* Also install the packages kable and kableExtra (and any other packages that you may get prompted to install!)
* Create a folder called _code_ and a directory called _objs_ at the same level (so both in the same folder, not one within the other) somewhere on your computer (for example, in a folder specific to R projects or to this meetup)
* Save example\_markdown.Rmd in the _code_ folder and open in RStudio.
* Press the "knit" button and see what happens! What files get generated and where are they?
